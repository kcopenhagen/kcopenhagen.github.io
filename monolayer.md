## Myxo monolayers

This is a clip of my simulation output modeling the bacteria Myxococcus xanthus as it spreads across a surface. It is a basic bead-spring chain model with self propulsion. The model is fully 3D allowing for such high densities. The simulation was constructed by me using LAMMPS and adding some custom written functions to be able to model out of equilibrium systems.
